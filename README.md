# sudokusolver
This stack-based sudoku solver was inspired by Project Euler [problem 96](https://projecteuler.net/problem=96). Its main method, 'solve("sudokufilename")', takes a .txt file containing sudokus as input and creates a .txt file 'solved_sudokufilename' of the solved puzzles. 

###Files
* sudosudoku.py contains the methods of the sudoku solver
* sudoku.txt is from Project Euler.
* solved_sudoku.txt is the result of running solve("sudoku.txt")
* tough.txt is a particularly difficult sudoku puzzle
